# Quick Start

### Requirements

- C23 Clang
- Make
- pkg-config
- SDL3

### Clone, Build, & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jspingu/threefold.git
cd threefold
make
./out
```

Press `Esc` to toggle control. Look around with the mouse, move with WASD, Shift, and Space. Scroll the mouse wheel to change the field of view.

### Vectorization Options

By default, vectorized function variants are built for all supported SIMD extensions on the target architecture and called through dynamic dispatch.

To build a tailored binary with static dispatch instead:

```bash
CFLAGS="-march=native" VECTORIZATION="static" make
```

Supported extensions:
- x86: SSE2, AVX2, AVX512F
- ARM: NEON (v7), SVE
